# Holidaze - Project Exam 2

## Description

This is a school project where a recently launched accommodation booking service called Holidaze wanted a new front-end for their application.
As the developer, I had full freedom to design and build the user experience, but the client provided a list of required features that the site needed.

The site has two main parts:

- A **customer** side, where users can explore venues and book their vacations.

- A **manager** side, where venue managers can register, edit, and manage their own venues.

I decided to build this project with **Vite + React** because it’s fast to set up, has a clean developer experience, and works great with modern tools like **Tailwind CSS** and **React Hook Form**. The requirements included:

- Fetch venues from an external API and display them on the homepage
- Let users click on a venue to view detailed information on a separate page
- Allow registered customers to book a venue
- Customers can view their bookings on their profile page
- Managers can register, update, and delete their own venues
- Managers can view bookings made on their venues
- Users can search for venues by title or description
- Users can see available dates for a venue
